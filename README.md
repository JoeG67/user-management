This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It includes a fully-featured **User Management** interface with:

* Add, edit, and delete users
* Bulk delete with undo
* Search, filter, and sorting
* Optimistic updates with React Query
* Avatar support with remote image handling
* Styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and UI components

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages by modifying `app/page.tsx` or `app/users/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load custom fonts.
